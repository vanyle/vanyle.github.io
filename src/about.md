# About me

Hi. I'm Antoine Del√®gue. Some guy on the internet that likes to make cool HTML animation as well as other fun programming projects.

I'm interested in math, programming, science, cooking, squishmallows and everything that looks even remotely neat.

I put here stuff that I noticed or just nano projects I made in a few hours that look interesting and that can inspire
you to try out new ideas.

If you're really bored and you've already played around with all the stuff on this website, I suggest you checkout my non-HTML projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/vanyle)

If you want to hire me, you can also reach out at [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-antoine/).

You can contact me at the following email (just run the code below in a python interpreter):
I'm not putting the full email to avoid bot scanning it and me getting spams.

```python
"delegue" + "." + "antoine" + chr(64) + "gmail.com"
```
