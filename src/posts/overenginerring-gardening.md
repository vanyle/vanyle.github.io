# Overengineering Gardening
*How an engineer takes care of a plant*

I recently got a plant at work. For it to survive, it needs to be watered about twice a week.
One day, a coworker came to me to tell me that my plant was dying from thirst, its leaves were all brown and dry.

I decided to do something, the life of a living being depended on me!

Of course, there was no way I would remember watering a plant multiple times a week. I could setup an alert using something
like a Slack or Telegram bot, which is what another coworker did.

This is the smart thing to do, but I wanted to overengineer this a little.

So I bought a pump and water humidity detector of Amazon, and searched at home for a ESP8622, an arduino, a breadboard and some wires.

Right at the start, I knew that I wanted to have some kind of [monitoring system](https://datadoghq.com) on this.
