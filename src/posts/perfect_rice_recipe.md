# The perfect rice recipe

*After decades of trial and error, I present you the ultimate rice recipe! 🍚*

## The recipe

You can use a plate that you fill with rice to measure the amount you will prefer. Keep in mind that rice triples in size during cooking.
As I am a big eater, I will usually prepare about 200 or 300g, but feel free to make the amount you want.

> ⚠️ In my house, rice can be kept for 2 or 3 days in the kitchen without any issues.
> My kitchen is very dry and doesn't grows mold (fruits dry without going bad), so always check the appearance and smell of leftovers!

### With a rice cooker

1. Washing: Put the rice in the bowl of the rice cooker and wash it with cold water. You mix the water and the rice and strain the water repeatedly until
the water is transparent and not white with starsh. 

2. Add about 1 big table spoon of salt, mix and taste the water. It should have enough salt so that you can taste it, but little enough that you could drink the
water without being bothered by it. You can replace the salt with 1 and a half table spoons of MSG if you want. 

3. Then, add 2 tea spoons of sugar. You won't feel the sugar directly, but it will make the rice taste a lot better. If you serve the rice to people, never admit that
you added sugar because it will ruin the experience for them. Know that all restaurants add sugar to their rice.

4. Add water to the rice cooking bowl until the water level about an index finger's height above the rice level, or about 6 cm.

5. Start the rice cooker and wait for your awesome rice to be ready.

### Without a rice cooker

Without a rice cooker, you can follow the same preparation steps, but you'll need to manually control the temperature and cooking time for your rice.

You'll need to cook your rice at a medium flame at first, then a small one for about 10 minutes. Ideally, you want your rice water to be boiling, but barely.
After 6 or 7 minutes of cook time, I recommend stiring and regularly tasting samples to make sure the rice is not overcooked.
There is variation in cook time because everybody's stove is a bit different.

## I have my rice, how what?

This rice recipe should yield fluffy rice that so good that you can eat it alone.

However, rice is a lot better with a sauce or as a side. You have a lot of options here.

You can use a fatty source like heavy cream or humous. The fat prevents the rice from clumping and make it even more flavorful. Melted butter also pairs well with it.

In my opinion, tomato and other acidic sauces don't go well with rice, they are for pasta. This is because acid gives a rotten taste to rice (bad rice tastes acidic, don't ask me
why I know that 😭).

Other classic rice toppings include garlic, onions (regular, green onions and red onions are all great) and spicy chili sauces like [Laoganma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_Gan_Ma) and also great.

Enjoy ❤️!!
